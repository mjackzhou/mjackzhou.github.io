      <div class="seven columns"><p>I am motivated by two considerations: 1) that climate change is the leading global concern of the 21st century, and 2) the issue is as much political as it is scientific. As a result, my research is focused on how climate change is communicated in American politics, how the public perceives the issue, and the effects of polarization on the political process. I rely on a variety of methodological tools to accomplish this work, including public opinion surveying, survey experimentation, and quantitative/qualitative content analysis. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing sports, and rooting on my (many) Bay Area teams.</p></div>
